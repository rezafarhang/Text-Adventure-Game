actually I wanted to rob without being trapped and I suddenly found this cool people and I said why not? And I could also get my sons patronage!
I met David in prison, after  I got free one day I saw him out of the blue and we got into talking and we decided to do this and we found Mark on social media and the other were the friends of those two.
Dumb Mason!
Mark, obviously
I didn’t want to let Mason kill him, so I tried to stop him that the gun fell near me.
because of Mason’s hat that fell and he was afraid that the dealer might recognize him, so he shot him and because of the shooting sound people called you.
At first me and David wanted to take it all, after that I decided to take it all and kill David!
