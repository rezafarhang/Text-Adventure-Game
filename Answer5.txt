actually I really didn’t want to rob again but Jack egged me on and besides that it was a great deal of money.
I knew Jack from the prison.
Mason, that nasty troublemaker.
Mark, obviously.
I think so, but this was a bad idea because I’m so slow and stupid!
After people heard the shooting sound they quickly called the cops and Mark didn’t let us to escape and we got totally busted.
Jack and me. What a Bigs mistake.
