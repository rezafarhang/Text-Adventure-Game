actually it was a long time since me and my fiancé wanted to get married but we couldn’t afford the money, so this was a really good chance.
Jack and David were talking about their plan while they were in my cab and I heard about it and threatened them to join them.
I heard a shoot sound while i was in my car and i have no idea who killed the dealer!
Mark, obviously.
I trusted my guts!
after the shoot sound, we all lost track of our plan and during that moment the cops suddenly arrived.They are really fast.
Jack, I guess.
